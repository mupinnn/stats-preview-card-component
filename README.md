## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm finding easy and simple way to create image overlay without adding empty div. Just use CSS `::after` pseudo-element selector, and fit it with the image container size.

### Continued development

For future projects, I'm still curious and want to dig dive more about grid and flexbox, creating asymmetrical layout, etc. BEM, and other methodologies packed to my learning list too!
